Hey everyone. We used Coqui for the voice in one of our more impressive demos, "YC Startup Advice Bot". It helped us build something awesome. Unfortunately, Coqui has ceased operations, which is a shame. This situation highlights why open-source projects are so valuable.

These projects make awesome tech available to everyone. If projects like Coqui have a paid version, using that's a great way to support them.  You can also help with their code if you're a developer, or just by sharing your experience on social media.

We're working on a new demo called the CoquiTributeBot. It's still using our vocode turn-based tools, but now it'll teach people about Coqui's work and get them excited about open-source projects. Think of it as a way to honor Coqui's legacy and show that open-source innovation never stops!
